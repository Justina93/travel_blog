                    <p><span class="first-words-first">Scotland</span> is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. Covering the northern third of the island of Great Britain, mainland Scotland has a 96-mile border with England to the southeast and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, the North Sea to the northeast and the Irish Sea to the south. The country also contains more than 790 islands, principally in the archipelagos of the Hebrides and the Northern Isles. Most of the population, including the capital Edinburgh, is concentrated in the Central Belt - the plain between the Scottish Highlands and the Southern Uplands - in the Scottish Lowlands.</p>

					<p>The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the 9th century and continued to exist until 1707. By inheritance in 1603, James VI of Scotland became king of England and Ireland, thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms. Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with the Kingdom of England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain.</p>
					<p>In 1801, the Kingdom of Great Britain entered into a political union with the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (in 1922, the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being officially renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927).</p>

                    <p>The territorial extent of Scotland is generally that established by the 1237 Treaty of York between Scotland and the Kingdom of England and the 1266 Treaty of Perth between Scotland and Norway. Important exceptions include the Isle of Man, which having been lost to England in the 14th century is now a crown dependency outside of the United Kingdom.</p>
					<p>The Highlands and Islands lie to the north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, which runs from Arran to Stonehaven. This part of Scotland largely comprises ancient rocks from the Cambrian and Precambrian, which were uplifted during the later Caledonian orogeny.</p>

				<h2>Welcome<br>to Scottish<br>Highlands</h2>

				<p><span class="first-words">The Highlands and Islands</span> is an area of Scotland broadly covering the Scottish Highlands, plus Orkney, Shetland and Outer Hebrides (Western Isles).
                The Highlands and Islands are sometimes defined as the area to which the Crofters' Act of 1886 applied. </p>

				<p>Scotland's wildlife is typical of the north-west of Europe, although several of the larger mammals such as the lynx, brown bear, wolf, elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times. There are important populations of seals and internationally significant nesting grounds for a variety of seabirds such as gannets. The golden eagle is something of a national icon.Red deer stag with velvet antlers in Glen Torridon. On the high mountain tops, species including ptarmigan, mountain hare and stoat can be seen in their white colour phase during winter months.[148] Remnants of the native Scots pine forest exist[149] and within these areas the Scottish crossbill, the UK's only endemic bird species and vertebrate, can be found alongside capercaillie, Scottish wildcat, red squirrel and pine marten. Various animals have been re-introduced, including the white-tailed sea eagle in 1975, the red kite in the 1980s,and there have been experimental projects involving the beaver and wild boar. Today, much of the remaining native Caledonian Forest lies within the Cairngorms National Park and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across Scotland. On the west coast, remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest still remain, particularly on the Taynish peninsula in Argyll, these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout Scottish history.</p>

                    <p>The image of St. Andrew, martyred while bound to an X-shaped cross, first appeared in the Kingdom of Scotland during the reign of William I.</p>
					<p>King Alexander III in 1286 an image of Andrew was used on the seal of the Guardians of Scotland who assumed control of the kingdom during the subsequent interregnum. Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the saltire, has its origins in the late 14th century; the Parliament of Scotland decreeing in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on the front and back of their tunics.</p>
					<p> Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the 15th century. Since 1606 the saltire has also formed part of the design of the Union Flag. </p>
					<p>There are numerous other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the thistle, the nation's floral emblem (celebrated in the song, The Thistle o' Scotland), the Declaration of Arbroath, incorporating a statement of political independence made on 6 April 1320, the textile pattern tartan that often signifies a particular Scottish clan and the royal Lion Rampant flag.</p>
                    <p>Highlanders can thank James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose, for the repeal in 1782 of the Act of 1747 prohibiting the wearing of tartans.</p>
					<p>St Andrew's Day, 30 November, is the national day, although Burns' Night tends to be more widely observed, particularly outside Scotland.</p>

					<p>The national animal of Scotland is the unicorn, which has been a Scottish heraldic symbol since the 12th century.</p>
                    <p>Scottish music is a significant aspect of the nation's culture. A famous traditional Scottish instrument is the Great Highland bagpipe, a wind instrument consisting of three drones and a melody pipe, which are fed continuously by a reservoir of air in a bag. </p>

				<p>Edinburg It was in Scotland's capital city that JK Rowling started to plot the adventures of Harry and his pals. With cobbled streets, winding alleys and medieval architecture, the city certainly has a few things in common with the settings from the books and films. She wrote the early chapters in various cafés around the city's Old Town, before coming back to finish off the series from a peaceful suite in The Balmoral Hotel, away from all disruptions. </p>

					<p>The Elephant House claims that JK Rowling spent endless hours in the 1990s gazing out of the window and dreaming up her magical characters. With its beautiful views of Edinburgh Castle, the café has become known as the 'Birthplace of Harry Potter'. You can also see JK Rowling's handprints set in stone at the Edinburgh City Chambers on the Royal Mile. </p>
					<p>If 'apparating' isn't an option for you, it's possible to travel by train from Edinburgh to Glasgow and from there, take the West Highland Line to Fort William. This is a great way to see some famous spots from the window, including the mystical Rannoch Moor, the place where Death Eaters board the train in the movie Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows: Part 1. </p>
					<p>If you're taking the train and you have time to kill, admire some of Glasgow's gorgeous gothic architecture in the West End which might remind you a little of Hogwarts. Fancy a challenge? See if you can find some chocolate frogs for the journey ahead. The train to Fort William should take just under four hours.</p>
					<p>Witness the sweeping cinematic scenery straight out of the eight blockbuster films by booking a seat on the Jacobite Steam Train, which travels from Fort William to Mallaig along the West Highland Line. </p>
